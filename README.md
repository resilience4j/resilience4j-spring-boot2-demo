# Spring Boot 2 demo of Resilience4j

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/resilience4j/resilience4j-spring-boot2-demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/resilience4j/resilience4j-spring-boot2-demo)

This demo shows how to use the fault tolerance library [Resilience4j](https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j) in a Spring Boot 2 application.

See [User Guide](https://resilience4j.readme.io/docs/getting-started-3) for more details.

The [BackendAService](https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j-spring-boot2-demo/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/robwin/service/BackendAService.java) shows how to use the Resilience4j Annotations.


The [BackendBController](https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j-spring-boot2-demo/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/robwin/controller/BackendBController.java) shows how to use the functional style and the Spring Reactor operators.
